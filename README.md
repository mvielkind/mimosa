# mimosa- An Open Source Waitlist Management System

This is an ongoing project I'm building on my Twitch stream. The inspiration is to provide an open-source, easy to use, system for managing wait lists for businesses.

The objective of the system is to:

- Allow customers to use SMS to signup, cancel, and get their position on the waitlist.
- Businesses can easily manage the waitlist and send relevant updates to the the customer when it's their turn.
- Make the whole system easy to deploy

Each week I'll update the code with what's been accomplished so far, so check back for updates!
