# mimosa- An Open Source Waitlist Management System

This is an ongoing project I'm building on my Twitch stream. The inspiration is to provide an open-source, easy to use, system for managing wait lists for businesses.

The objective of the system is to:

- Allow customers to use SMS to signup, cancel, and get their position on the waitlist.
- Businesses can easily manage the waitlist and send relevant updates to the the customer when it's their turn.
- Make the whole system easy to deploy

Here is a screenshot of what the final product could look like using my favorite fish friends from Finding Nemo!

Each week I'll update the code with what's been accomplished so far, so check back for updates!
